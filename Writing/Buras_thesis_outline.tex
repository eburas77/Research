Eric Buras 3/3/16 Master's Thesis Outline
\\
\section{Abstract}
Briefly mention graph laplacian, the linear system, applications to problems, how I am doing it

\section{Introduction}
Why is this problem important. Talk about PageRank and other "ranks" ie proteinrank, generank

\section{Background}
Already written first draft\\
probably needs a lot more depth in the literature review\\
probably more papers out there on graph laplacian solvers besides LAMG, CMG, and the Penn state people

\section{Methodology}
Fan Chung's local and global portion\\
multigrid on local portion and why it is optimal\\
direct solve on sparse portion\\
linear algebra to combine\\
somewhere in here need to explain networkx and petsc i think?\\
if we write in C talk about how it is first implementation


\section{Results}
Complexity analysis of all the individual parts\\
how fast is splitting for n edges?\\
multigrid O(n)\\
direct sparse solve is ?\\
how many mat-mat, mat-vec multiplies in the sherman morrison\\
table of times for different size graphs\\
maybe try to get it on a cluster to parallelize, or maybe do this after initial thesis defense\\
maybe try to compare with LAMG in matlab\\

\section{Applications}
graph laplacian linear systems of different types\\
C. elegans neural network\\
proteins and genes\\
facebook social networks\\
others? electric grids?\\

\section{conclusions}
talk about what worked and didnt\\
what will be improved upon\\
